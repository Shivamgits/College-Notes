INTRODUCTION OF MASS TRANSFER
• Mass transfer may occur in a gas mixture, a liquid solution or solid.
• Mass transfer occurs whenever there is a gradient in the concentration of a species Driving Force
• The basic mechanisms are the same whether the phase is a gas, liquid, or solid.
• The transfer of mass within a fluid mixture or across a phase boundary is a process that plays a 
major role in many industrial process.
MASS TRANSFER IN NATURE
• Aquatic life uses dissolved oxygen for survival and supply of oxygen comes from air
• Absorption of O2 into the blood stream occurs in the lungs of animals and 
removal of CO2 from the animal cells into the blood stream
• Hydrolyzed food materials get absorbed in the intestines
• Process of doping the junctions of a semi-conductor
• Dispersion of a pollutant discharged at a point in flowing water
SEPARATION PROCESS
INTRODUCTION TO SEPARATION PROCESS
• Separation of mixtures constitutes major class of operations in CPI and allied industries
• The separation process involved are based on the principles of mass transfer 
and are called mass transfer operations
• Typical Examples Of Separation process:
▪
Separation of ammonia from mixture of ammonia and air by water
▪
Separation of organic vapor from mixture of gases by adsorption
▪
Separation of CO2 from flue gas CO2 capture
▪
Separation of mixture on the basis of volatility by Heat input

DIFFUSION
UNDERSTANDING BY EXAMPLES

• Fragrance of bunch of roses and perfume reaches out to a person
• Dissolution of sugar in water
MOLECULAR DIFFUSION
• Def: Molecular diffusion or molecular transport can be defined as the 
transfer or movement of individual molecules through a fluid by mean of the 
random, individual movements of the molecules.
• The phenomenon leads ultimately to uniform concentration
• The two modes of mass transfer:
- Molecular diffusion
- Convective mass transfer

EXAMPLE:
Q. A mixture of He and N2 gas is contained in a pipe at 298 K and 1 atm total pressure 
which is constant throughout. At one end of the pipe at point 1 the partial pressure 
pA1 of He is 0.6 atm and at the other end 0.2 m pA2 = 0.2 atm. Calculate the flux of
He at steady state if DAB of the He-N2 mixture is 0.687 x 10-4

A. Since a total pressure P is constant, the c is constant, where c is as follows for a gas

• For steady state the flux J*Az in Eq.(6.1-3) is constant. Also DAB for gas is constant. 
Rearranging Eq. (6.1-3) and integrating.
• Also, from the perfect gas law, pAV=nART, and
This is the final equation to use, which is in a form easily used for gases.
Partial pressures are p A1 = 0.6 atm = 0.6 x 1.01325 x 105
= 6.04 x 104
Pa and pA2 = 0.2 
atm = 0.2 x 1.01325 x 105

Then, using SI units,
• In a non-uniform solution containing more than two constituents, leads to the use 
of two fluxes to describe the motion of one constituent:
• N, the flux relative to a fixed location in space
• J, the flux of a constituent relative to average molar velocity of all constituents

MASS TRANSFER COEFFICIENTS
• The Rate of Mass transfer increases dramatically if there is motion in the medium
• Mass transfer occurring under the influence of motion in a fluid medium is 
called Convective mass transfer

ANALOGY WITH HEAT TRANSFER
INTERPHASE MASS TRANSFER
UNDERSTANDING BY EXAMPLES
• Absorption of ammonia from Ammonia-Air Mixture by liquid water
• Absorption of CO2 from flue gas by amine solvents
• Removal of H2S from natural gas
• In above examples gas is absorbed at the interface of two phases and 
gets transported to the bulk of liquid
EQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN PHASES
• Equilibrium between two phases in contact 
means a state in which there is no net 
transfer of solute from one phase to other.
• At equilibrium the concentrations in two 
phases aren’t equal but chemical potential 
of solute in both phases is same
• Diffusion of components between phases 
continues till Equilibrium is attained
TWO FILM THEORY
• Mass transfer from one phase to another involves three steps:
1. Solute is transported from bulk of one phase to interface
2. Diffusion of solute occurs across the interface
3. Transport of solute to bulk of second phase
• Two phase theory states: Lewis & Whitman
• Basic concept – the resistance to diffusion can be considered equivalent to that in stagnant film 
of a certain thickness
• Two stagnant film exist on both side of interface
• Mass transfer through these films occurs by Molecular diffusion
• No resistance to solute transfer exists across the interface separating the phases
• Resistances in fluid are the only resistances.

OVERALL MASS TRANSFER COEFFICIENTS
• We define two overall mass transfer 
coefficients, as shown below:
• Resistances to mass transfer are 
expressed in terms of Overall and local 
mass transfer coefficients as;
• When m` is small When m`` is very large
GAS ABSORTION & STRIPPING
• Gas absorption is a mass transfer operation in which one or more species is 
removed from a gaseous stream by dissolution in a liquid [Solvent]
• The insoluble component(s) present in the gas which is not absorbed is called 
Carrier gas
• Examples:
Removal of H2S from natural gas
• The reverse of absorption is stripping or desorption
SELECTING A SOLVENT FOR ABSORPTION
• Solubility Selective solubility for the solute
• Volatility Less volatile solvent is preferred
• Viscocity Low viscosity
• Corrosiveness Less corrosive solvent
• Cost Low cost solvent
• Hazard & Toxicity Non hazardous and non-toxic
GAS-LIQUID CONTACTING
EQUIPMENTS
TRAY TOWERS
• Vertical cylinders in which the liquid and gas are contacted in stepwise fashion on 
trays or plates.
• To provide good contact between the up flowing vapor and the down flowing liquid 
inside an industrial fractionating column.
• Liquid enters-top and gas-from downwards through the opening
• Each tray – act as a stage
• The tray fluid are brought into intimate contact
• Interphase diffusion occurs
• Fluids are separated.

SHELL AND TRAY
• Can be made of any number of materials.
• Glass, Glass-lined metal, impervious carbon, 
plastic, even wood can be used.
• But most frequently metals are used.
• For metal towers the shells are usually cylindrical for 
reason of cost.
• For cleaning, small-diameter tower are fitted with hand holes.
• Large towers with manholes about every tenth tray.
TRAY SPACING
• It is usually chosen on the basis of :
➢
expediency in construction
➢
maintenance
➢
cost
➢
For special cases where tower height is an important 
consideration spacing of 15 cm has been used.
PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH TRAY 
TOWERS
• Entrainment
• High pressure drops
• Priming
• Flooding
• Weeping/Dumping
• Foaming
• Coning
PACKED TOWERS
• A common apparatus used in gas absorption is the packed tower as shown in 
previous Figure
• The device consist of:
a) cylindrical column or tower
b) gas inlet and distributing space at the bottom
c) liquid inlet and distributor at the top
d) gas & liquid outlets at the top & bottom, respectively
e) tower packing – supported mass of inert solid shapes
PACKINGS
• The packing
- provides a large area of 
contact between the 
liquid and gas
- encourage 
intimates contact 
between the phases
• Common dumped 
packings are shown in the 
figure:
CALCULATION OF TOWER HEIGHT

DRYING
UNDERSTANDING BY EXAMPLES
• Wood, cloth, paper etc. can be dried by evaporation of the moisture 
into a gas stream.
• A solution can be dried by spraying it’s fine droplets into a hot, 
dry gas which results in the evaporation of the liquid.
• A liquid such as Benzene can be dried of any small water 
content by distillation but removal of small amount of acetone 
by same process would not usually be called drying.
PHYSICAL MECHANISM OF DRYING
• The removal of moisture from a substance is termed as drying
• Drying is governed by principle of transport of heat and mass
• First the surface moisture vaporizes, as soon as surface moisture is exhausted more 
moisture is transported from inside the solid to its surface
• Broadly three transport resistances play important roles in drying:
• Resistance inside the solid to the liquid
• Convective heat transfer resistance at surface
• Convective mass transfer resistance at surface
DRYING EQUILIBRIUM
• Moisture contained in a wet solid or liquid solution exerts a vapor pressure to an 
extent depending upon the nature of moisture, nature of solid and temperature
• If a wet solid is exposed to a continuous supply of fresh gas containing a fixed 
partial pressure of vapor p, the solid will either lose moisture by evaporation or gain 
moisture from the gas until the vapor pressure of moisture of solid equals p
• The solid and the gas are then in equilibrium, and the moisture content of solid is 
termed its Equilibrium-Moisture content at prevailing condition
• The equilibrium moisture of a given species of solid may depend upon the 
particle size or specific surface, if the moisture is largely physically adsorbed
• Different solids have different
moisture curves as shown in figure
• Generally inorganic solids which 
are insoluble in the liquid and 
show no special adsorptive 
properties such as Zinc oxide, 
show relatively low equilibrium
• A solid which is hygroscopic shows 
a relatively high equilibrium moisture
The following term are commonly
used in designing of drying systems:
• Moisture content of a substance which exerts as 
equilibrium vapour pressure less than of the pure 
liquid at the same temperature is referred to as 
bound moisture.
• Moisture content of the solid which exerts an 
equilibrium vapour pressure equal to that of pure liquid 
at the given temperature is the unbound moisture.
• The moisture content of solid in excess of the 
equilibrium moisture content is referred as free
moisture. During drying, only free moisture can be
evaporated. The free moisture content of a solid 
depends upon the vapor concentration in the gas.
DRYING RATE
• The rate of drying can be determined 
by suspending it in a cabinet or duct 
in a steam of air, from a balance
• From the data a curve of 
moisture content as a function of 
time can be plotted
• If the data are converted into rates or fluxes of drying, expressed as N, much 
information can be obtained when plotted against moisture content.
• There are two major parts in the rate curve:

A period of constant rate (region RQ)

A period of falling rate (region RT)
DRYING TIME
• The drying rate is given as:
• Rearranging and integrating over a time interval while moisture content changes from X1
to X2 gives:
• For constant-rate period:
• For falling-rate period and N is linear in X:
CRYSTALLIZATION
• Crystallization is the formation of solid particles within a homogenous phase.
• It may occur as the formation of solid particles in a vapor, as solidification from 
a liquid melt, or as crystallization from liquid solution.
• Crystallization from solution is important industrially because of the variety of 
materials that are marketed in the crystalline form.
CRYSTALLIZATION KINETICS
• Crystallization is a complex phenomenon involving three steps:
(1) nucleation,
(2) mass transfer of solute to the crystal surface, and
(3) incorporation of solute into the crystal lattice
• Supersaturation is the driving force for crystallization kinetics
• As crystal size decreases, solubility noticeably increases, 
making it possible to supersaturate a solution if it is cooled 
slowly without agitation
• The solubility of very small crystals can fall in the metastable region
SUPERSATURATION
• Supersaturation is the concentration difference between that of the supersaturated
solution (C) in which the crystal is growing and that of a solution in equilibrium with the 
crystal (Cs).
∆C = C-Cs
• Fractional Supersaturation:
where S is concentration ratio and s is fractional 
supersaturation • In practice, s is usually less than 2%
NUCLEATION
• Nucleation means formation of tiny new crystals 
in a supersaturated solution.
• The rate of nucleation is the number of new 
crystals formed per unit time per unit volume of 
magma or solid-free mother liquor’.
• Relative rates of nucleation and growth are 
important because they determine crystal size 
and size distribution.
NUCLEATION TYPES
PRIMARY NUCLEATION
• Supersaturated solution is free of 
crystalline surface
• Requires high supersaturation and is the 
principal mechanism in precipitation
• It can be homogenous or heterogenous
SECONDARY NUCLEATION
• Supersaturated solution contains crystals
• Key in commercial crystallizers, where crystalline 
surfaces are present and large crystals are desired
• Initiated by fluid shear past crystal surfaces that 
sweeps away nuclei, collisions of crystals with 
each other, and collisions of crystals with metal 
surfaces (crystallizer vessel wall or agitator blades)
• most common since they happen at the low 
values of relative supersaturation,
TYPES OF PRIMARY NUCLEATION
HOMOGENOUS NUCLEATION
• Occurs with supersaturated solutions in the 
absence of foreign matter, such as dust
• molecules in the solution first associate to 
form a cluster, which may dissociate or grow
• if a cluster gets large enough to take on the 
appearance of a lattice structure, it becomes 
an embryo → stable crystalline nucleus
HETEROGENOUS NUCLEATION
• The formation of crystals on tiny 
suspended foreign particles or on the 
surface of the crystallizer
• The rate of nucleation depends not only on 
the supersaturation but also on the 
availability of active sites for nucleation
